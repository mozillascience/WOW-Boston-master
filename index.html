        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some of the projects and interests your #MozWOW colleagues are bringing to the workshop:
        </p>
        <section>
          <section><p><strong>Victor Luiz da Silva</strong><br />I currently have multiple programming projects on different stages of development; most of them are work/research related but I also have a few personal projects I've been trying to work on.</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Josh Bolick</strong><br />My project is a collaboratively written and maintained open educational resource for emerging librarians to learn about scholarly communication librarianship. We want to leverage open education as a tool to increase teaching and knowledge in our field about how our work is done. This resource itself will be open, collaboratively maintained, and in perpetual beta.</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Mai Bui</strong><br />I am working as an intern at the City of Lawrence Utilities Department for nutrient removal purposes. Nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus) is a limiting substances in water bodies which can cause eutrophication that kill fish and water animals. We are on the research to reduce the concentration of them to minimize the risk after discharging water to the river.</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Matthew Copeland</strong><br />Since I work with multiple professors on different projects, I have the opportunity to introduce new development practices as the opportunity arises. Since many of our projects are going to be having open data and software requirements coming into effect soon, we are already starting to look into different avenues for fulfilling these requirements.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://compbio.ku.edu/">http://compbio.ku.edu/</a> </p></section>
          <section><p><strong>David Hansen</strong><br />Working on open educational resource textbook on adolescent development and on the intersection of human development and neuroscience.</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Michelle Kelly</strong><br />I'm one of Amy Burgin's students at the KBS (Kansas Biological Survey), and am just starting to develop a project based on open-source USGS stream gage data. I'm using data pulled from real-time nitrate sensors and comparing streams with high nitrogen concentrations (such as in agricultural areas, which receive large amounts of fertilizer application) to streams with low nitrogen concentrations. Hopefully I'll be able to visualize how nitrogen processing by plants and microbes can change in these different concentration environments, which could tell us more about how pollution effects the within-stream environment itself. Fingers crossed!</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Hannah Kinmonth-Schultz</strong><br />I do not have an open project currently, but do collaborate with scientists in Europe and other parts of the U.S.A. I feel that working in the open could be a great way to collaborate, as well as improve experimental rigor, accountability, reproducibility, and build public trust. I do worry, as probably do many scientists, about ideas being "scooped" before I have time to develop them.</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Boryana Koseva</strong><br />Since my main responsibility is to analyze data for researcher groups, I am interested in adopting practices that allow me to be open about my practices and progress, and make my work reproducible.</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Michael Peper</strong><br />One current project is to survey KU librarians about their engagement with campus partners to analyze current gaps and strengths. We will likely do interviews or focus groups with selected respondents.</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Dhanashree Thorat</strong><br />I am interested in developing a project around decolonizing archives. I am not sure what form this project would take, but I want to experiment with building an open access archive that experiments with archival structure, interface, and content.</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Michael Wu</strong><br />No project running now. I'd like to know what kind of Open Data we could adapt in to government/city management. What's possible impact of it? And how can we deploy it?</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Karna Younger</strong><br />I do not have an immediate project, but am working with a group that is collecting a lot of data that will need to be properly stored, etc. In general, want to learn more about open data and how that can benefit this particular project.</p></section>
          <section><p><strong>Allison Zhang</strong><br />My project is focusing on using a small molecule drug to improve neuropathy. We found it worked in diabetic neuropathy, a transgenic neuropathic model and are currently showing promising effects in a model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.</p></section>
